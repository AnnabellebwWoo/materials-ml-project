Predicting elastic modulus from composition using multiple ML models.

## Materials Problem
Measuring material properties experimentally: expensive, time-consuming, resource-limited. 
Instead: screen new materials from databases of widely-known compositions with machine learning. 
Material composition is always known, but structure may not be known early on in materials design,. 

## Dataset Source
